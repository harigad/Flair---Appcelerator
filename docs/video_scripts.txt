 - Narrator: Young college girl working at a coffee shop.
 - Hight Level Script:

"Sooo 2 weeks ago this girl I was serving coffee to told me that she..."Flair'ed me. OKKK... I thought whatever..
Earlier this week 2 more of my customers told me that they also "Flair' ed me...and that I must sooo join "Flair"

Soooooo...I downloaded this app "Flair" onto my phone. Turns out ...lot more people had Flair'ed me.  Well, what is a "Flair" you ask!  I had the same question. 
  
"Sooo ...Flair is this neat little  app that enables people to recognize and appreciate effort and great service. ...
Like  when you are at a coffee shop or at the library or the Bank and you enjoy your experience and want to thank the person ,recommend or just show your gratitude. You can just open the app and do that with just the click of a button.

Did I mention just the click of a button..meaning I can't and don't have to break your brain to write something.

Sooo..now I like this App so much that when I am out shopping and I like the person helping me I might actually give them a flair. 

Why you say ? Soooo. because now I myself enjoy getting a Flair on my phone in the middle of a day. It makes my effort feel a little more appreciated..
Welllll..you can say it adds a little Flair to my otherwise busy day.
